# TERRA-AI: ClimateChain Context

## Overview
ClimateChain is a decentralized platform for climate verification and accountability. It uses AI, satellite imagery, and blockchain to verify environmental actions (like reforestation) and issue carbon credits.

## Key Components
- **Satellite AI Monitor**: Uses models like YOLOv8 to verify tree planting and land use from satellite data.
- **Blockchain Ledger**: Uses Polygon (PoS) to mint ERC-721 certificates and ERC-1155 carbon credits.
- **Marketplace**: A place to trade verified carbon credits.

## Project Structure
- `Project Plan/`: Contains the PRD, Design Document, and Technical Rules.
- `ClimateChain_PRD_v1.0.md`: Product Requirements Document.
- `ClimateChain_Design_Document_v1.0.md`: UI/UX and visual system details.

## Usage
This extension provides the Gemini model with high-level awareness of the ClimateChain project goals, architecture, and documentation.
